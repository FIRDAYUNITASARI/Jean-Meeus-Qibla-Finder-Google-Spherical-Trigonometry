# Jean-Meeus-Qibla-Finder-Google-Spherical-Trigonometry
The Jean Meeus-Qibla Finder Google - Spherical Trigonometry method calculates the Qibla direction by spherical trigonometry, considering the curvature of the earth for high accuracy. This method uses the law of spherical cosine and haversine law to determine the angle between the local meridian and the line towards the Kaaba.
